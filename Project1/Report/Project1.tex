Conditionals are implemented, but only for boolean expressions on integer types.


\section{Array handling}

\section{Syntactic sugar - foreach}
We've implemented a basic foreach language construct that, within the interpreter, translates into a while loop. An example of a foreach construction can be seen below.
  \begin{lstlisting}
foreach var in collection do
  // statements where var is accessible
od
 \end{lstlisting}
 As of this writing, the extensions' grammar, AST and translation is functional, but faces three obstacles before being fully working;
 \begin{itemize}
   \item \texttt{var} is not aliased to \texttt{collection[i]}, where \texttt{i} is the i'th element in the collection. This prevents programs from actually accessing \texttt{var} within the block of the foreach loop.
   \item To make the iteration progress, an increment statement should be appended to the body of the foreach loop
   \item The \texttt{.length} attribute, as of now, only handles declared arrays and not arrays returned from expressions. As foreach takes in an expression, further extensions are needed to the attribute system. 
\end{itemize}
\section{Infix logic operators}
Initially we wanted to extend the language with infix versions the implemented operators. However, to avoid breaking already implemented test cases, we instead added two new operators -- the logic AND and OR. This enables the following syntax;
\begin{lstlisting}
let
  boolvar :  <>(x,5) or <(y,10) and >(y,0)
in
  ...
end
\end{lstlisting}
Parsing and evaluation works, but unfortunately we have a shift-reduce conflict in both logic expression that we have not been able to resolve.
