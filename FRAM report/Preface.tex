\chapter{Preface}

This thesis was prepared at the department of Informatics and Mathematical Modelling at the Technical University of Denmark in fulfilment of the requirements for acquiring an BSc. in Informatics. 

The thesis deals with the aspect of human factors in accident models.

The thesis consists of an introduction to different accident model as they have evolved throughout time - from the early linear models to the modern non-linear complex models.\\
For the latter, a simple accident will be modelled to help illustrate the usage, and strengthen the discussion of its validity and application.

As the accident being modelled is railway associated, some terminology about railway safety is provided, in the scope it was found necessary.

%TODO - maybe this, somewhat fun. story.
%I've been interested in philosophy for about as long as I've lived, of course I didn't know what my reflecting thoughts were called until later in the education system.
%My second big interest is software - on the more close hardware level. This passion led eventually led me to DTU, that led me back to philosophy. Imagine my surprise over this wierd completion of a circle.
