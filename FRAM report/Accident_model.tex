\chapter{Modelling an accident}
\label{ch:accident_model}
Using FRAM restrospectively will, hopefully, identify some of the critically constrained couplings between functions in a system. Appling this knowlegde, it will be possible not only to build safer, but also more resillient system.

\section{Near miss at Train crossing}
Modelling a near miss incident is not very common, though very rewarding in terms of drawing experience from them.

In this thesis, we will model a simple near miss incident.

(Some background about the near miss)

This represents a simple accident.
