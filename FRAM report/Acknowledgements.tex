\chapter{Acknowledgements}
First, would like to thank Erik Hollnagel, among others, for all the very useful literature he have had published.

I would also like to thank my supervisor at Atkins Denmark; Per Stolze which is, quite frankly, a human encyclopedia on train and railway safety - and has been (mis)used as such during the writing of this thesis.

Last, but certainly not least, I would like to thank my lovely girlfriend - who has supported me during the writing of this thesis, and throughout all my over-ambitious projects.
