\paragraph{Req.1 One product, a coke-can.}
The cocke-can is the only product our vending machine can offer. This make the purchase senario of one coke-can our main senario. hence all our code revolves around this very requirement.

\paragraph{Req.2 When a sufficient amount is inserted, one cocke-can will be dispensed from the machine.} From the Purchase-state we will change to the Dispence-state if sufficient money has been inserted, that will lead to the dispence of one coke-can.

\paragraph{Req.3 The product is fixed to 7 kr. ( in design this should be changeble ).} By changing this signal the price of one coke-can can can be changed. Unfortunately there are no inputs available for this action. we have agreed that a recompile would be neede to change the value.
