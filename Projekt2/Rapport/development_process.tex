A software development process is the structure needed to development any type of software products. 
There are several models for such development processes, each describing differed approaches to get the software developed.

\subsection{Software Development Models}
Many of the larger scale models such as Unified Process, Waterfall, Scrum or Spiral Model isn't suitable for small projects  of  4 weeks. But on the other hand Models like eXtreme Programming haven't got the diagrams and design phases needed for our learning curve of VHDL. The model we used was a mix of the differed models that had all the phases and methods we needed.

\subsection{Planning phase}
In this phase we read the assignment, analyze the requirements and go over the inputs, outputs and hints.
Then we made the first version of our High Level State Machine and.

\subsection{Implementation phase}
With the information from planning we started programming the VM. During this process we made our Data path diagram and several updates to the State Diagram.

\subsection{Testing phase}
In the Testing Phase all our test benches has been made to find the last few bugs and errors. 

\subsection{Documenting phase}
In the Documenting phase we had all the information needed. A working product, a lot of diagrams, and many test cases. We wrote our documentation in \LaTeXe  because it focuses more on documentation that typesetting and it makes managing and maintaining larger papers easier.
