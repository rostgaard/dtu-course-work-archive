known plaintext attacks
The simple caesar cipher, can be broken only knowing a sigle letter, but a more real life example is WEP(Wired Equivalent Privacy). It has been shown that it can be broken, with a passive attack but that requries tousinds of packages. In 2006 Bittau, Handly and Lackey showed that by only capturing a single package, followed by sending 128 packages, it is possible to get the key.

chosen plaintext attacks.
If we look at the Vigenère cipher, that one can easily be broken if you choose a text that is at least the key lengh, which only consists of the same letter, for instance: if the Key is "HALLO" then we could choose the plaintext "AAAAA", which would be encrypted to: HALLO. and just like that we get the key.
