\paragraph{Exercise 1:} Decrypt the following ciphertext that was encrypted with a Caesar cipher

Output from program \Code{exercise\_01.adb}:

\lstinputlisting[frame=single] {../output/exercise_01.output}

\paragraph{Exercise 2:}
The ciphertext ``ABQZ'' can translate to either ``STIR'' or ``OPEN''.

9.000+ was found by means of brute force and an English dictionary.

\paragraph{Exercise 3:}
\paragraph{Exercise 4:}
\paragraph{Exercise 5:}
%In one hour 11.385.500.000 keys tested.

For this, not very efficient implementation, 2.160.000.000 keys was tested in an hour.\\\\
This gives $600000 \cdot 24 \cdot 365 = 18.921.600.000.000 \approx 19 \cdot 10^{12}$ in a year.\\\\
Given a cluster of 1 million machines, the number would be $19 \cdot 10^{12} \cdot 10^6 = 19 \cdot 10^{18}$ keys attempted, roughly corresponding to ~64 bit.\\\\
Code is listed in figure \ref{lst:exercise_05}.

\section*{Exercise 6}
For $|K|$, our keyspace is $26!$, $R_L$ is $26$, which gives us;
\begin{equation}
UD \approx \frac{\log_2{26!}}{0.7 \cdot \log_2{26}} \Leftrightarrow UD \approx 26.7
\end{equation}

\section*{Exercise 7}
\section*{Exercise 8}
\section*{Exercise 9}
Our test-population is 1000, given that we have 1000 \emph{pairs}.\\
Feeding the this to the $\chi^2$ test gives the following;
\begin{eqnarray}
\chi^2 = \frac{\left(231 - 500\right)^2}{250} + 
         \frac{\left(271 - 500\right)^2}{250} + 
         \frac{\left(270 - 500\right)^2}{250} + 
         \frac{\left(228 - 500\right)^2}{250} \\
\chi^2 = 6.744
\end{eqnarray}

This is then fed to R, which gives out:

\begin{eqnarray}
CHIDIST \left(6.744,3\right) = 0.08
\end{eqnarray}

Around 8\% of the experiments will result in a distribution similar to this. We should not reject this as acceptable output, as it is within the standard 95\% confidence interval. Since the probability is so low, more data should be acquired to get more accurate results.

\section*{Exercise 10}
\section*{Exercise 11}
Putting the table into a functional graph, we observe that it consists of two disjoint cycles. One of them being merely $4 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 4$.
When using the input vector consisting of identical elements (all 3's), we observe the function repeating itself after 14 iterations.\\
The only exception is when using 9 as initialization vector. This gives us a loop of one, repeating 9 as input for the next element.
