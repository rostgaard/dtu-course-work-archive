The GunKiAnDem (see abstract) operating system is at its end and although it is not ready to sell yet, we feel that we have done a good job and achieved a respectable result.
We have implemented most of the functionality provided by a professional operating system but in small scale using a skeleton source. We managed to make a few of the harder A assignments resulting in even more functionality, yet we sadly did not complete the memory protection, long messages in IPC and the terminal driver we wanted to implement in assignment 7.\\
\\
The practical assignment described in section~\ref{sec:practical} would not have been easy to implement without having spent some time implementing the system calls done in the preceding sections.\\
All the way from trying to make the first system call do a ``Hello world''-ish message up to thread syncronizations and device drivers.\\
The development of the course operating system has been an educational process, where one theory builds up to, and helps understanding, the next.\\
\\
The field of operating system study is a great use to any programmer, at is enables him/her to optimize his/her code to fit the operating system, and makes it easier to improve performance, stability and debugging.\\
