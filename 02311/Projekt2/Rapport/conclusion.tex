The project works as requested. It has a few flaws, but overall it works well. The development process has been very constructive, using the iterative methods. When something was not working, or we were stuck on a subject, there were usually a step to move back or forward to. When a logical error occurred and something did not act as planned, it was very useful to go back and rethink thinks using the state and datapath diagrams.\\
These were also useful when discussing implementation issues with TA's.\\

VHDL has a pretty steep learning curve, but as soon as you start to understand the ideas and meaning of the language, you also see the versatility and power of the language.\\
