Thoroughly testing the VM will help identifying the correctness, completeness and quality of the system. Testing can however never completely establish the correctness of a system but its a good indication. These test are mainly a comparison of the expected output and actual output.
In the development and testing phase of the VM several test benches has been made to follow the actual data flow.    

\subsection{Test Cases}
Five test benches with the most complex functionality has been set as Test Cases.
\subsubsection*{Test 1:  Dispense one coke}
This test will insert 7 kr with a mix of 2 kr and 1kr coins and finalize with finish\_purchase.\\
\\
Precondition: Power on.\\
Expected result: VM will dispense a coke and become available to the next purchase.\\
Actual result: One coke was dispensed and the system became available for the next purchase.\\

\subsubsection*{Test 2 : Return change from purchase}
This test will Insert 8 kr with 4 x 2 kr coins and finalize with finish\_purchase.\\
\\
Precondition:  Power on, Change available.\\ 
Expected result:  VM will dispense one coke, return 1 kr change and become available for next purchase.\\
Actual result: One coke was dispensed, 1 kr in change and ready for next purchase.\\
Wave Diagram: Figure~\ref{fig:test2} in appendix~\ref{app:figures}

\subsubsection*{Test 3 : Return all coins if no change is available}
This test will insert 8 kr with 4 x 2 kr coins and finalize with finish\_purchase.\\
 \\
Precondition:  Power on, no change available.\\
Expected result: VM will return all coins and and become ready for next purchase.\\
Actual result: Coins where returned and ready for next purchase.\\

\subsubsection*{Test 4 : Return inserted coins}
This test will insert 6 kr with a mix of 2 kr and 1kr coins and finalize with return all coins.\\
 \\
Precondition:  Power on.\\
Expected result: VM will return all inserted coins and become ready for next purchase.\\
Actual result: All coins where returned and ready for next purchase.\\

\subsubsection*{Test 5 : Difficult coin order }
This test handles difficult coin order purchase, with no change available and finalize with finish\_purchase.\\\
 \\
Precondition:  Power on, No change available.\\
Expected result: VM will dispense one coke, give 1 kr change and become ready for next purchase.\\
Actual result: One coke dispensed, 1 kr change and ready for next purchase.\\

\subsection{Test Conclusion}
All tests has given the desired output. The differed testing scenarios has given a clear indication that the VM works properly and has the desired functionalists given by the requirements.
