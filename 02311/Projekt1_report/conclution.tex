We have successfully implemented the desired circuit on the FPGA board. 
All the functionality described in Project 1 is implemented, tested and fully functional.
Simulation and test benches have proven their effect on the correctness of our code before implementations.

\subsection{Work proces} 
For this project we have mainly used pair programming where Kim has been the main programmer.
Due to the short time period of the project no project development methods has been taken in use.
