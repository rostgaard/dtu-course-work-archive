The desired circuits has been successfully implemented on the FPGA board. All the functionality described in the abstract is implemented, tested and are fully functional on Logic Gate Level and Register Transfer Level. Simulation and test benches have proven their positive effect on the correctness of the code. The RTL level design proved a lot more human-readable and compact.

\subsection{Work process} 
For this project we have mainly used pair programming where Kim has been the main programmer.
Due to the short time period of the project no project development methods has been taken in use.
