\subsubsection*{Structure}
This report is broken up into smaller parts focusing on individual implementation components. The body tries to do a theory-to-implementation 
flow on each component. These sections can therefore (mostly) be read induvidually without breaking context. When it does, there usually is a 
reference to where the concept is explained.
