\subsection{Rate monotonic scheduling}
Rate monotonic scheduling (RMS) is used when you have a set of periodic tasks without the need for preemtion.

% List the assumptions under which the RMS fall

% Explain RMS theory

\subsection{Schedulability analysis}
The schedulability analysis is based on the following theory:
% TODO Bla bla theory

\subsubsection{Generation of the random numbers}
Uniform distribution. 

\begin{quotation}
Returns a pseudorandom, uniformly distributed int value between 0 (inclusive) and the specified value (exclusive) ... All n possible int values are produced with (approximately) equal probability
\end{quotation}

Perhaps a seed could be used for recreating the random numbers

\subsubsection{Tracing}
Can you determine what situation created the worst-case response time for a particular task (what other tasks interrupted it, when, and for how long)?


\subsubsection{Response time guarantee}
%Can you guarantee that the response time will not be larger than the worst-case numbers you get from the simulator?

% What happens if you simulate using the execution time equal to WCET?
