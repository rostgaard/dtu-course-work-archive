In electrical power production there has to be a balance between production an consumption meaning that production must equal consumption at all times.\\ This is a problem because consumer demand and thereby the load on the electrical grid is unpredictable. Luckily the electric power generators represents a rotating mass which means that energy can be stored as kinetic energy governed by the rotational speed.\\ In this system a mismatch between production and consumption will influence the frequency of rotation of the system in such a way that an over consumption will lower the frequency and in worst case cause a black out, overproduction would cause the frequency to get higher.\\ To prevent this, research is done to make equipment intelligent in such a way that they react on the grid frequency by turning off loads or even putting power back in to the system, the last option is an ideal opportunity in a society with a large fleet of electric battery powered vehicles.\\ In the event of overproduction loads can be turned on in order keep the frequency at the right level, until production can be regulated down, a large fleet of electric battery powered vehicles would also be a way of saving energy for later use.

This course in hands-on micro controller programming concerns the use of a micro controllers applied as a part of an intelligent energy system. The micro controller is used to measure the grid frequency and control loads connected to the power grid. In this way we have a frequency responsive system that can adapt its consumption based on the frequency of the power grid.
