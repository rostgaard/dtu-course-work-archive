In electrical power production there has to be a balance between production an consumption meaning that production must equal consumption at all times. This is a problem because consumer demand and thereby the load on the electrical grid is unpredictable. Luckily the electric power generators represents a rotating mass witch means that energy can be stored as kinetic energy governed by the rotational speed. In this system a mismatch between production and consumption will influence the rotational frequency of the system in such a way that an over consumption will lower the frequency and in worst case cause a black out. To prevent this research is done in to make consumer products intelligent in such a way that they react on the grid frequency by turning off loads or even putting power back in to the system, the last option is an ideal opportunity in a society with a large fleet of electric battery powered vehicles.

This course in hands-on micro controller programming concerns the use of a micro controllers applied as a part of an intelligent energy system. The micro controller is used to measure the grid frequency and control loads connected to the power grid. In this way we have a frequency responsive system that can be adapt its consumption based on the frequency of the power grid.
