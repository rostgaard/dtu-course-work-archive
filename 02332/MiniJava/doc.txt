We decided to keep the code structure given to us at the start of the project.

We have constructed some test files. Both test, that should compile successfully.
(test.java)
But also test scenarios that should result in errors when trying to compile them
(testForErrors.java)

To test for all the errors, each test scenario should be placed in a file of their own and tested individually. 
This way the compiler would not just stop by the first error and not test the rest
