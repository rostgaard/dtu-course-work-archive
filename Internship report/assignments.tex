\chapter{Assignments}

\section{Railway theory}
Although technically not an assignment, I have decided to include this as part of my internship report. This i mainly due to the fact, that I have spent i great deal of time studing the concepts and application of railway technology and application.

I have taken a course in "introductory railway concepts" during my stay at Atkins.


\section{Document and technical drawing archiving}

This project never left the theoretical discussion stage.

\section{Defining and documenting a V\&V process}
This project was the main time-consumer of my time. It is a large project, already in progress, which meant that there was a vast quantity of documentation to read through.

This task involved reading though the existing documentation - which was extensive. And Modelling. See \cite{Rostgaard_VandV:2011}



\section{Learn concepts and application of FRAM}
