----
Description
----

The toolset consists of three parts; A schedule validator, a track validator and a visualizer. 
In brief, it's a toolset for aiding the the user in validating a train track network - and
schedules.

---
The Visualizer
---
The purpose of the visualizer is to provide a means for visually inspecting the schedules and tracks.

---
The track validator
---
The purpose of the track validator is to ensure that a track network is valid, given the constraints.

---
The schedule validator
---
The purpose of this tool, is to provide guarantees that no trains will ever collide - give a schedule.

----
Requirements
----

 - A java compiler
 - JUNG Graphing library
 - A GNAT 2012 compiler
 - GNU make

The Ada sources can be built by invoking make in the toolset folder, but are command-line only.

----
State of the program
----
Currently the program is not throughly tested, and the schedule validator is not able to load in
files - but will validate them if given statically.


 - Enjoy.
