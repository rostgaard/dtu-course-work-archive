To enable synthesis of FPGA/CPLD hardware, XST will assume that all necessary signals are present in the sensitivity list. Please note that the result of the synthesis may differ from the initial design specification. The missing signals are:

<msg type="warning" file="Xst" num="737" delta="unknown" >Found <arg fmt="%d" index="1">8</arg>-bit latch for signal &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="2">q</arg>&gt;. Latches may be generated from incomplete case or if statements. We do not recommend the use of latches in FPGA/CPLD designs, as they may lead to timing problems.
