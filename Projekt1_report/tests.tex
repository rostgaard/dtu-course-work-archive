During development of the circiut, we did out testing via a number of VHDL testbenches. These were used to assert that our 
develeopment went in the right direction, and also to verify that the indivudial circuits worked as planned.
\subsection{Testbenches}
During development we used three major testbenches. One for the combinatorial circuit, one for the register, and one for the 
two put together.
