During development of the circiut, we did out testing via a number of VHDL testbenches. These were used to assert that our 
develeopment went in the right direction, and also to verify that the indivudial circuits worked as planned.

\subsection{Testbenches}
During development we used three major testbenches. One for the combinatorial circuit, one for the register, and one for the 
two put together. 

\subsubsection{Combinatorial circuit}
To make sure the logic of the circiut was working correctly we made a testbench where we gave all possible inputs to the circuit,
did a simulation and compared the outputs from modelsim to our truth table. This testbench can be found in the file ``Runner\_logic\_tb.vhd''.

\subsubsection{Register}
Testing the behavior of the register was a matter of setting a value to input, and wait for a rising edge clock. The input value 
should then be updated. This was also done by visual inspection in modelsim. This testbench can be found in the file ``Runner\_Registry\_tb.vhd''. 
(We apologize for misspelling register.)

\subsubsection{Interaction between register and combinatorial circuit}
The file ``Runner\_tb.vhd'' does simulation on the circuits put together, and their interaction with each other over time (clock cycles). 
When running the testbench we observe both the state increment and the digit and top outputs change according to our truth table.
