\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chap:conclusion}
In the beginning of the project we spent a great deal of time cleaning and refactoring code, making it more modulary and easy to navigate. But as the application evolved and grew in size and complexity, it became increasingly difficult to maintain a consistency in the code. Espeacially when thing were not doing as planned. New code arose in places where it did not belong.\\
From this we have learned about the importance of defining a clear program structure and functionality from the start of the project, and enforcing it thoughout the development process.\\\\
The webserver is responding slowly, but is very functional. The xsl transformations works like a charm in modern browsers and should definitly be considered in the case of an official http+xml implementation.\\\\
The LCD screen, acting as both in- an output, gives a quick way of getting an overview of the current status of the system. As well as modifying the system paramters realtime.\\ The values displayed are a bit off, due to programming errors. But it gives you an idea on how a finished system should look and behave.
