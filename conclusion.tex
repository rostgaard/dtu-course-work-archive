\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chap:conclusion}

In the beginning of the project we spent a great deal of time cleaning and refactoring code, making it more modulary and easy to navigate. But as the application evolved and grew in size and complexity, it became increasingly difficult to maintain a consistency in the code. Espeacially when thing were not doing as planned, new code arose in places where it did not belong.
