\chapter{Comparison of RESTful and SOAP/BPEL web services}
}
As we have implemented the TravelGood business process using both RESTful and WSDL, a number of strengths and weaknesses has been experienced, which is discussed in this section.\\\\
In general, while implementing the business process, as specified in the requirements, has clearly been simpler using REST, it is our impression that the solution maps better to the business process when using BEPL.

\section{Ease of under standing}
The BEPL implementation reads better for people with non-technical background due to the visual representation.

\section{Adaptability to change}
Changed requirement are part of every project, in this aspect maintainability a critical factor. With REST, if there is a change to the public API, you have to make everyone agree manually on the interface, or handle arbitrary failures. With WSDL

\section{Scalability}
As RESTful is by-design specified to be scalable.

\section{Other notes}
Other comparison parameters are the transmission and parsing overhead, where REST+JSON clearly surpasses SOAP messaging -- especially if extensions such as WS-Addressing and WS-Security are used, as the problems solved by these technologies are not tacked by REST, but by other layers of the application.
