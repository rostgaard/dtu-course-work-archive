\chapter{Conclusion}
Writing up the business logic in both BEPL and REST has given a good insight in strengths and weaknesses of both technologies. While REST is, by far, the easiest technology to both get a working tool chain up and running for, and learning -- it is also the weakest in expressiveness.  BEPL, and hereby WDSL+SOAP provides an implicit documentation that is extremely valuable for project running for a very long time -- with many different developers -- as everything is described as business logic, or at least very close to native business logic as possible.\\\\
BEPL gives the best overview of the coordination between services -- and effectively also validation and verification thereof -- whereas REST relies on the ability of to write and understand code to, and general-purpose static analysis tools fed with the semantics of the model.
