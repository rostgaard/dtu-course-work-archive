This report documents the design and implementation of a travel agency service The travel agency acts as a coordinator by composing and synchronizing bookings and accounts from third party actors.

\section{Introduction to Web Services}
The current trend within distributed systems is using the world wide web and it's technologies as a transportation and encapsulation layer. As these technologies are standardized, interoperability becomes less of a hassle than if every protocol should be implemented from scratch.\\\\
From the times where first static web pages emerged in the new World Wide Web, upto now, a big evolution process has taken place. This process may be described best as; chaotic. Everyone that has done web programming within the last 10 years will flee in terror by pronouncing to them the letters IE.\\
But, that aside, from this evolution it became clear that standards should drive the web forward - as they had from the days of HTTP 0.9. And as web applications grew larger and became increasingly dynamic and intercoupled, it also became clear that interfacing was a lot more problematic than what could be handled \emph{ad-hoc}.\\\\
The following section is a description of some of the key technologies we will use in this report, along with a brief discussion on some of the objective strengths and weaknesses.

\begin{description}
\item[HTTP] The \textbf{H}yper\textbf{T}ext \textbf{T}ransfer \textbf{P}rotocol is a plaintext stateless request-response protocol with standardized methods and response codes. It is deployed everywhere, from coffee machines to mainframes and thus a robust technology to base a web application on. Most programming languages have auxiliary libraries that provide both HTTP client and server components for re-use.

\item[XML] The e\textbf{X}tensible \textbf{M}arkup \textbf{L}anguage is a subset of the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) and has a very famous cousin named Hypertext Markup Language - or HTML. XML is, basically, a general purpose markup language for adding semantics to documents. This semantic is further formalized by either linking a Document Type Definition (DTD), or an XML Schema (XSL) to the document. A large advantage of XML is that it, like HTTP, is a widely used standard, and most programming languages have libraries for using XML without having to parse everything. XML - being a generalized language - has the further advantage that you can build new standards as XML applications and inherit the well-formedness\footnote{Grammatically and semantically correct.} property of of XML itself, and the general XML parser can used.

\item[WSDL] \textbf{T}he \textbf{W}eb \textbf{S}ervice \textbf{D}efinition Language is an XML application introducing formalism to web application in an attempt to unify the diverging methods for collaborating via web.

\item[SOAP] \textbf{S}hoddy \textbf{O}verbloated \textbf{A}ccess \textbf{P}rotocol is another XML application % Simple Object Access Protocol
SOAP is independent of HTTP, and can therefore not inherit any information deriving from HTTP headers - even if used over HTTP.

\item[BEPL] \textbf{B}ullshit \textbf{P}olluted \textbf{E}xecution \textbf{L}anguage %Business Process Execution Language is also an XML application
%TODO Should we discuss this one, or just mention it in the bank interface section? \item[UDDI/service discovery]

\item[REST] The concept \textbf{RE}presentational \textbf{S}tate \textbf{T}ransfer covers the architecture defined by Roy Fielding and is specific application to HTTP (1.1) and centralized around the concept of resources and representations\footnote{Typically states of resources}. Resources are accessed and changed by ordinary HTTP methods: GET, PUT, POST, DELETE and standard HTTP 1.1 response codes are used to explain to the caller how the request went. For instance, a DELETE operation on a non-existing ID could return a 404 - Not Found, while it would return 200 - OK if all went well. There exists no (standardized) formalization language to describe RESTful web services, like there does with WSDL.

\item[JSON] \textbf{J}ava\textbf{S}cript \textbf{O}bject \textbf{N}otation is an object serialization language that is human-readable -- much like XML. One of the big advantages of JSON over XML is, however, that grammer, and thus effectively, the parser is very simple. It is also less verbose than XML and therefore has less overhead. It has draft support for schemas, and has currently no general way of validating data, or enforcing constraints. Due to its simple nature, it doesn't support any other types than the ones that are built-in. JSON is typically used in web applications, and in strong collaboration with the REST paradigm.
